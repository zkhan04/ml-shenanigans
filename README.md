# ml-shenanigans
This is mainly me messing around with ML and from-scratch implementations.

## Files:
- nn-from-scratch-with-numpy.ipynb Version 1
  - this is a digit classification network i built from scratch using numpy (so unique I know ðŸ’€).
  - the current version only has a 10% accuracy (which is no better than throwing at a dartboard). There's obviously a bug
  - but I've still gained lots of confidence with manipulating ndarrays, making use of vectorization, and understanding how forward and backpropagation work.
